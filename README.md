## Description and features

Problem statement: The task was to build a simple Task Management Dashboard where users can view,
add, edit, and delete tasks.
Requirements:

2. Allow users to add, edit delete task.
3. Filter task by status.
4. Sort task.
5. Provide a summary at the top of the dashboard showing the count of tasks in each status.
6. Use a responsive layout (grid or list view) with a modern UI.
7. Include a modal or a form component for adding and editing tasks.

- Tech-Specific Requirements:

1. Use state management (e.g., Context API, Redux, or RxJS for Angular).
